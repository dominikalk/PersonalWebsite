            developing games with the Unity game engine and have been developing
            personal games since. As well as developing web apps and games in my
            free time, I am studying Computer Science at Cardiff University and
            will graduate in 2024. My goal in Web and App Development is to
            create clean and efficient code bases as to reduce the probability
            of bugs being incorporated, whilst keeping the design responsive,
            and I&apos;m also looking into getting into full-stack development,
            hence why I&apos;m currently teaching myself NestJS.
